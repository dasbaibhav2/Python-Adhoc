LIST
In a List when you want to remove a value you can use a.remove(100) or a.pop(100), Both are same.



DICTIONARY
keys should be unique in a dictionary. When you want to search you can't use indexing. You have to search using keys.
a.keys()
It will print all the keys in a dictionary.
a.values()
It will print all the values in a dictionary.
When you want to append in a dictionary you can write using a['c']="hello"
If you want to replace in a dictionary use a['c']="Bye"




SET
Set will remove duplicacy.
You can write set in a={1,2,3,4,"X"}


FOR LOOP
When you want to find any module using dir

import sys
for i in dir(sys):
	if 'ar' in i:
		print(i)


When you forget what list tupple or dictionary work on you can call them by
list()
tuple()
dict()

How to print the upper loop code in a list?
-->  [i for i in dir(sys) if 'ar' in i]
